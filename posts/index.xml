      <description>Two years ago, Alex Irpan wrote a post about why &amp;ldquo;Deep Reinforcement Learning Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Work Yet&amp;rdquo;. Since then, we have made huge algorithmic advances, tackling most of the problems raised by Alex. We have methods that are sample efficient [1, 21] and can learn in an off-policy batch setting [22, 23]. When lacking a reward function, we now have methods that can learn from preferences [24, 25] and even methods that are better fit to escape bad local extrema, when the return is non-convex [14, 26].</description>
